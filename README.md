Story Engine: a part of the [StoryTechnologies](http://www.storytechnologies.com/) project.

StoryTechnologies is a set of software tools for content creators to enable the development and publishing of engaging visual stories on the web, mobile, and desktop.

StoryTechnologies’ core application provides for a unique storytelling experience by combining the following elements:

* A high-level semantic description of 3D environments based on a bespoke graph database
* WebGL-based interactive scene browsers
* Procedural content generation (including procedural writing)
* An opinionated [architecture of stories](http://www.storytechnologies.com/2016/05/minimum-viable-story/)

StoryTechnologies is built (directly) on top of the following technologies:

* [Blend4Web](https://www.blend4web.com/), a tool for interactive 3D visualization for the web
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), a free and open source 3D creation suite

StoryTechnologies was founded in 2015 by [Brett Kromkamp](https://twitter.com/brettkromkamp) in Bodø, Norway.
